> *"Most coders think debugging software is about fixing a mistake.
> But that's bullshit.
> Debugging is actually all about finding the bug, about understanding why the bug was there to begin with.
> About knowing that its existence was no accident.
> It came to you, to deliver a message, like an unconscious bubble floating to the surface. popping with the revelation you've secretly known all along.
> The bug forces the software to adapt, evolving into something new because of it.
> Work around it or work through it.
> No matter what, it changes. 
> It becomes something new.
> The next version. The inevitable upgrade."*
